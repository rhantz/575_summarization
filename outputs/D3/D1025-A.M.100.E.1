Fish and Wildlife Service is preparing to remove Yellowstone 's grizzly bears from the endangered species list later this year .
State and federal agencies will monitor the bears and their habitat and responsibility for managing bears will be turned over to Montana , Idaho and Wyoming .
`` The Yellowstone grizzly is the Endangered Species Act 's best recovery story , '' said Chris Servheen , a University of Montana professor and head of the federal agency 's grizzly bear recovery team .
