Officials have said up to 45 people , including eight soldiers , were killed in the clashes between the Frontier Corps troops and Bugti tribesmen , who dominate Dera Bugti .
Armed tribesmen have surrounded some 300 paramilitary troops and government officials at a base in a southwestern Pakistani town where fears of fresh fighting between renegade tribesmen and troops have forced thousands of residents to flee for safety , an official said Sunday .
Lasi said Sunday that about 5,000 Bugti tribesmen have taken up positions in mountains near Dera Bugti .
