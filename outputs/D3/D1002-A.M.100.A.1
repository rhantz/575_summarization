When the officers saw afterward that Diallo was unarmed , the people knowledgeable about the case said , at least one of the officers wept .
The Diallo family 's lawyers believe this bullet , as well as a second bullet that the autopsy says hit Diallo 's middle toe `` adjacent to the front of the nail , '' indicate that Diallo was shot after he had fallen .
The officers _ Kenneth Boss , Sean Carroll , Edward McMellon , and Richard Murphy _ pleaded not guilty to the charges .
