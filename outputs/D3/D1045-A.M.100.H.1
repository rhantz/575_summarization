The Songhua River is a tributary of the Heilong River ( called Amur River in Russia ) on the border between the Russian far east and China .
Currently , the water supply has been cut off in Harbin , capital of northeast China 's Heilongjiang Province , as the city 's water source , Songhua River , has been heavily polluted .
The enlarged water current would not only help dilute pollution in the river , but also slowed down freezing of the river water downstream .
