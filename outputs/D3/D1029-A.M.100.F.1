Lasi said Sunday that about 5,000 Bugti tribesmen have taken up positions in mountains near Dera Bugti .
Thursday 's fighting in Dera Bugti _ about 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) from Pakistan 's main gas fields _ was an alarming escalation of a low-level tribal rebellion in Baluchistan , the country 's poorest province .
Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after eight people died in a rocket attack on Pakistan 's largest gas plant at Sui , which the tribesmen said was sparked by the rape of a female doctor at the installation .
