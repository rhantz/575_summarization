The European Union head office said Friday it was allocating euro98.1 million ( US $ 122 million ) on testing cattle across the 25-nation bloc to prevent the spread of mad cow disease next year . 
The European Commission helps co-fund the testing with national governments . 
The human form of mad cow disease is called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob . 
Japan has screened every cow slaughtered for consumption after confirming mad cow , or bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) , in its own herd in September 2001 . 
Cases have also been detected in the United States and Canada .
