HAIKOU , June 22 ( Xinhua ) -- A tropical rain forest project is to start soon in south China 's Hainan province .
The province has limited the number of trees to be chopped down in the forest area in northwest Yunnan and has stopped building sugar factories in the Xishuangbanna region to preserve the only tropical rain forest in the country located there .
Malaysia , also endowed with rich tropical rain forest , will build bases on its territory to pick up and analyse data from the satellites .
