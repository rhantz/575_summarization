Jianfeng Mountain tropical rain forest , covering more than 44,600 hectares , is now the largest in China .
It first set up a tropical primary forest protection zone in the area in 1951 .
The province has limited the number of trees to be chopped down in the forest area in northwest Yunnan and has stopped building sugar factories in the Xishuangbanna region to preserve the only tropical rain forest in the country located there .
