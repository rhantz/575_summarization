Ambassador Hong Seok-Hyun called the office of President Roh Moo-Hyun late Monday and offered to resign , presidential spokesman Kim Man-Soo said , indicating Hong 's resignation would be accepted . 
Gong had headed a special wiretapping team from the National Intelligence Service , the main spy agency . 
The recordings reportedly contain discussions about a proposal to give three billion won ( 2.9 million dollars ) to the then-ruling party chief Lee Hoi-Chang . 
He is a brother-in-law of Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee . 
Kim Dae-Jung beat Lee in a presidential election in late 1997 .
