The managed reserve method is `` the beginning of a new approach to managing oysters and oyster disease , '' said Goldsborough of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation .
As a key source of food for other fish and a major filter for the algae and other particles in the bay , the menhaden `` ecologically speaking , ( is ) the most important animal '' in the bay , the Chesapeake Bay Foundation says .
It has emerged as an issue now because the native oyster -- crucial to filtering the bay 's waters and supporting its fleet of watermen -- has almost vanished from the Chesapeake .
