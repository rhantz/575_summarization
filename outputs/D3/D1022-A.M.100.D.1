The International Whaling Commission , or IWC , banned commercial whaling in 1986 , but grants limited permits to countries such as Japan that maintain whaling programs for scientific purposes .
But the government opposes an application in Australia 's Federal Court to prevent a Japanese whaling company entering the Australian-declared whale sanctuary in Antarctica , which Japan does not recognise .
In rejecting the application , Judge James Allsop said Australia does not have a legal right to stop whaling in international waters protected by Australia because Japan does not recognize Australia 's jurisdiction there .
