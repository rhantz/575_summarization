The survey found that 32 percent of amphibian species face extinction , compared to 12 percent of bird species and 23 percent of mammal species .
The severity of the global threat to thousands of species of frogs , salamanders and other amphibians makes them perhaps the most endangered class of animals on Earth , with their rapid decline outpacing that of mammals and birds .
Of the 5,743 known species of toads , frogs , salamanders , newts and worm like amphibians , 1,856 ( 32.5 percent ) are under threat , according to the work by 500 researchers in 60 countries .
