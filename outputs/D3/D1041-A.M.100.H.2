In 1998 , an El Nino global coral bleaching event caused deaths of many coral reefs , a disaster occurring only once in 1,000 years . 
Regional marine programme co-ordinator for South and Southeast Asia with the IUCN ( World Conservation Union ) in Colombo , Sri Lanka , Jerker Tamelander , said damage to the marine ecosystem could be '' very , very serious . '' 
Tamelander said many coral reefs in the Indian Ocean were just beginning to recover from damage caused by the changing water temperatures generated by the El Nino weather pattern .
