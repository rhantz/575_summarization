On Monday , Hariri and eight other people were killed in a huge explosion , which occurred as Hariri 's motorcade was passing by in the seafront area of the Lebanese capital Beirut .
Over the years , Hariri became more and more concerned with Syrian influence in Lebanon , a product of Syria 's military and intelligence presence left over from the war .
Eido said his bloc would not participate in any meetings that include government opponents of Hariri and urged the government to keep away from Hariri's funeral .
