He said Jilin had quickly blocked entry of the pollutants into the river and discharged water from a reservoir to dilute pollutants in the river .

It has compelled cities along the river to suspend water taking from the river for various periods .
According to the official , observation data shows the degree of river water pollution has been declining .
