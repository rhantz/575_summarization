Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Wednesday that it remained '' unclear '' when it would be able to resume production on two of its platforms after a gas leak forced it to shut down operations earlier this week . 
Norway 's oil production has been reduced by some 205,000 barrels per day . 
Norway is the world 's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia , with an average daily production of three million barrels .
The company was partly privatized in 2001 when the state sold a 17.5 percent stake to investors .
