Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin , his doctor , Michael Zimpfer , said Saturday .
Yushchenko fell ill on Sept. 5 and has been treated at the Vienna clinic twice before .
If Yushchenko was deliberately given dioxin , it was done by `` someone was very clever and very knowledgeable , '' Schecter said .
Doctors said Saturday that damage to Yushchenko's digestive system suggested the poison had been ingested .
Yanukovych campaigners rejected suggestions that the prime minister could have been involved in poisoning Yushchenko .
