A special team has been set up by the Malaysian police to rescue the hostages and the Malaysian police are in contact with their counterparts in Southern Philippines in efforts to track down the kidnappers .
The tourists were reportedly taken hostage late Sunday on a remote resort island of Sipadan off the Sabah coast , eastern Malaysia .
Police there said the kidnappers in Malaysia spoke Tausug , a language spoken in parts of the southern Philippines , but not in Basilan , where the Abu Sayyaf rebels operate .
