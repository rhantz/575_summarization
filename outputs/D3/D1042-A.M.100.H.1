Prosecutors described Graner , who is said to be England 's ex-boyfriend , as the ringleader of a group of Abu Ghraib guards who mistreated Iraqi detainees .
When the judge asked England why Graner handed her the strap , England replied : `` He wanted it to look more degrading with a female of my size . ''
England 's lawyer , Rick Hernandez , asked Pohl to recuse himself because he had presided over all the other Abu Ghraib abuse cases .
England was one of seven members of the 372nd Military Police Company charged with humiliating and assaulting prisoners at Abu Ghraib .
