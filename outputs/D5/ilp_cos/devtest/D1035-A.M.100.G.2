HANOI , Vietnam ( AP ) _ The Vietnamese Red Cross launched a special fund Friday for victims of Agent Orange , saying the toxic defoliant is starting to claim its third generation of victims a quarter-century after the end of the Vietnam War . 
Nearly 2 million people lived in the affected areas . 
No one knows how many people suffer from the effects of Agent Orange , which was sprayed over wide swaths of jungle by U.S. planes during a 10-year period to strip away cover from North Vietnamese troops and their resupply convoys .
