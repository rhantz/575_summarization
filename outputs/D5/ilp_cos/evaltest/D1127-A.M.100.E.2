Sleep loss or disturbed sleep can heighten the risk for adolescents to take up smoking and drinking , according to a new study . 
The study found that a sleep deficit built up over just five nights can significantly impair heart function . 
One possible explanation for these differences is that lack of sleep causes the body to burn calories less efficiently . 
A separate study released in June by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that chronic sleep deprivation adds stress to the heart , putting a person at greater risk of cardiovascular disease and death .
