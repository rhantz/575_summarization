Seven near-simultaneous bomb blasts tore through crowded markets in the Indian tourist city of Jaipur Tuesday , killing at least 80 people and wounding 200 in what police said was a terror attack . 
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned the blasts and appealed for calm . 
India has been plagued by bombings across the country in recent years and routinely points the finger at foreign-based Islamic militant groups fighting its rule in the Himalayan state of Kashmir .
