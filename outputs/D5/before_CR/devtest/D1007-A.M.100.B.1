Macao residents are eating less birds these days although there has been no report of bird flu cases in Macao . 
The Department of Health prepared a fact sheet to explain to tourists the avian flu , which is caused by a virus H5N1 that is only found in poultry . 
The virus , known to cause `` bird influenza '' among chickens , apparently has been transferred to humans in Hong Kong . 
All hospitals and clinics in Hong Kong have been ordered to test patients for the flu .
