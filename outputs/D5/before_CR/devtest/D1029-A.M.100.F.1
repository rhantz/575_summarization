Eight soldiers were killed and 23 injured in fierce desert gunbattles with tribal rebels in Pakistan 's southwestern province of Baluchistan , officials said Friday . 
`` The situation in Dera Bugti is very tense . 
Baluchistan was rocked by a tribal insurgency in the 1970s and violence has surged again this year . 
Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after eight people died in a rocket attack on Pakistan 's largest gas plant at Sui , which the tribesmen said was sparked by the rape of a female doctor at the installation .
