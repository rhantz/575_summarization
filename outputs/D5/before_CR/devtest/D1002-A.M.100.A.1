Diallo 's father , Saikou Amad Diallo , arrived here Wednesday from the West African nation of Guinea and said he was anxious to see the officers not only charged , but brought to trial . 
Where was he when the four plainclothes officers began shooting ? 
Through their lawyers , the officers have said they thought Diallo had a gun . 
The officers were immediately suspended from the force . 
Off-duty police officers and more than 25 of Diallo 's friends and relatives packed the small courtroom for the 45-minute arraignment .
