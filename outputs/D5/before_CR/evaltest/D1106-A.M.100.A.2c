By 2004 , the number of adult Atlantic bluefin tuna capable of spawning had plummeted to roughly 19 percent of its 1975 level in the western half of the ocean , according to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas . 
Japan has also accepted a major cut in its quota for southern bluefin tuna in the Pacific Ocean as punishment for overfishing .
Representatives from the commercial fishing industry , environmental groups and government regulators are discussing ways to strengthen information sharing and cooperation among regional organizations to track and manage tuna stocks .
