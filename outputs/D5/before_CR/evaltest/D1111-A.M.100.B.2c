The shooting came after a video entitled `` Jokela High School Massacre -- 11/7/2007 '' was posted on the video-sharing website You Tube , reportedly some time in the past two weeks . 
An 18-year-old student at a school in Finland went on the rampage Wednesday , shooting dead seven classmates and the headmistress and wounding a dozen others before turning his gun on himself . 
The video zooms in on the school with heavy metal music blaring in the background and shows a young man against a red background pointing a gun at the camera .
