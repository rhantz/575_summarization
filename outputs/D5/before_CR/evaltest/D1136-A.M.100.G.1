`` There is huge potential for water saving in China , '' said Wang Shucheng , minister of water resources . 
The water shortage has affected the whole ecology of the Yangtze . 
Besides sea water desalination , Shandong is seeking more fresh water through China 's mammoth south-to-north water diversion program and the water diversion program of the Yellow River . 
China already faces a severe water shortage , especially in the northern part of the country . 
`` All the water in the southwest of China is fed by glacial melt , '' he said .
