So far , only Madoff , the firm 's 70-year-old founder , has been arrested in the scandal . 
Fear ran deep for investors in Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC . 
It is the second private Swiss bank to acknowledge having investments in funds managed by Madoff . 
Even before Madoff collapsed , some employees were mystified by the 17th floor . 
Madoff at some point started paying investors with money received from other investors , a Ponzi scheme , according to the SEC . 
Now , Fairfield is seeking to recover what it can from Madoff .
