Deputy District Attorney Cathryn Brougham said in opening statements last month that Alvarez had threatened to kill his wife and staged the accident to get her attention . 
A murder defendant apologized Tuesday for causing a commuter train disaster that killed 11 people , testifying that he was trying to kill himself and never meant to harm anyone else . 
Alvarez was convicted June 26 of 11 counts of first-degree murder and one count of arson . 
He could face the death penalty if convicted . 
About 180 people were injured .
