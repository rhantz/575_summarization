The federal government has proposed listing the polar bear as a threatened species , and the wildlife agency is receiving public comment on the proposal . 
Polar bears depend on sea ice so they can travel and float to hunt seal and to reach coastal areas off Greenland , Canada , Alaska , Russia and Scandinavia . 
Bears that continued to den on ice moved away from ice that was thinner or unstable . 
The hunting of bear cubs and pregnant bears is banned . 
Polar bears are not the only species threatened by global warming .
