The move comes two weeks after safety reviewers within the Food and Drug Administration urged the agency to consider an outright ban of over-the-counter cough and cold products for children under the age of 6 . 
`` The reason the makers of over-the-counter oral cough and cold medicine for infants are withdrawing these medicines is that there have been rare patterns of misuse leading to overdose recently identified , particularly in infants , '' said Linda A. Suydam , president of the trade association . 
The industry said that the medicines are safe and effective when used as directed .
