Britain 's food safety watchdog ordered the recall of more than 350 food products Friday after it said that a potentially cancer-causing dye had been discovered . 
`` The vast majority of products contaminated with the illegal dye Sudan I have been removed from sale , '' the agency said in a statement . 
Sudan I is banned from food in Britain and across the European Union , and since 2003 all chili powder imported to Britain must be certified to be free of Sudan I . 
The offending sample is thought to have entered Britain beforehand .
