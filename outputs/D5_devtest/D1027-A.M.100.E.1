( AP ) -- The strategy for the first defendant on trial in the beating death of gay college student gay college student Matthew Shepard is clear : blame the co-defendant . 
Anti-gay protesters and gay rights advocates have clashed repeatedly over the Shepard case . 
`` Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew Shepard , '' Skaggs said . 
Authorities said Henderson and the 21-year-old McKinney posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2 , 105-pound Shepard out of a bar , kidnapped him , pistol-whipped him and stole $ 20 . 
McKinney 's trial is set for Aug. 9 .
