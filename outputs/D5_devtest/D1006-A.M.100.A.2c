Heavily advertised as an arthritis drug , Vioxx was pulled from the market last week after its maker said a study showed it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke . 
In a separate report released by the New England Journal , Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Eric Topol of the Cleveland Clinic chastises the FDA for not requiring Merck to do studies investigating heart problems with Vioxx when hints of them first appeared years ago . 
An FDA official said the agency would have no immediate comment . 
But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said similar prescription drugs were safe .
