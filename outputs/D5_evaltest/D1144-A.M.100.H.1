According to Mattel , all the toys were made by a contract manufacturer in China . 
The company said it does not use the same factories as RC2 and its toys do not have lead paint . 
This is Mattel 's 17th recall in 10 years . 
RC2 is mailing customers new toys and reimbursing their postage . 
But business has been anything but usual for Totally Thomas Toy Depot , which specializes in Thomas & amp ; Friends toys . 
I absolutely would pay more for 'green ' toys , '' said Schneider-Fisher .
