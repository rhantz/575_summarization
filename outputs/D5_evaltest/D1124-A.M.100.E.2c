President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has ordered Lapindo to pay 3.8 trillion rupiah ( 420 million dollars ) in compensation and costs related to the mud flow .
A gas well near Surabaya in East Java operated by PT Lapindo Brantas has spewed steaming mud since May last year , submerging villages , factories and fields in the Sidoarjo district . 
Coordinating Minister for Top welfare minister Aburizal Bakrie claimed last month that the flow was a `` natural disaster '' unrelated to the drilling activities of Lapindo , which belongs to a group controlled by his family .
