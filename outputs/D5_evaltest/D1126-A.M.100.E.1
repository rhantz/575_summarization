Is there no safe haven for Bush ? 
Bush wiped the mess off with his bare hand . 
He then threw a shoe at Bush , who ducked and narrowly avoided it . 
The shoe attack came as Bush and al-Maliki were about to shake hands . 
The goal : keep Bush and his entourage safe on the trip to Iraq . 
`` The war is not over , '' Bush said , adding that `` it is decisively on it 's way to being won . ''
