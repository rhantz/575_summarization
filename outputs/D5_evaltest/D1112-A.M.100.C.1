`` the real Juan Alvarez never imagined that a train would derail or that anybody would die other than himself , '' Kielty said . 
the 29-year- old Alvarez 's car was hit by a Los Angeles-bound train , which derailed and then ploughed into a train travelling in the opposite direction . 
Alvarez has pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of murder and one count of arson . 
`` Alvarez did not intend to kill , '' Belter said . 
`` He told you himself he had homicidal thoughts that morning , '' Brougham reminded jurors about Alvarez 's testimony .
