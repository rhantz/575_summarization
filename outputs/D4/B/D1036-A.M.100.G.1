Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin , his doctor , Michael Zimpfer , said Saturday . 
Doctors in Vienna declined to speculate on exactly how Yushchenko was poisoned . 
`` It is possible that we only found the dioxin , '' he said . 
Doctors said Saturday that damage to Yushchenko's digestive system suggested the poison had been ingested . 
Yanukovych campaigners rejected suggestions that the prime minister could have been involved in poisoning Yushchenko . 
But none of that would affect Yushchenko 's political aspirations today .
