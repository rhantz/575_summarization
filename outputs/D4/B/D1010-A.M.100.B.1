The human form of mad cow disease is called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob . 
It is the second case since March in which the disease , also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy , or BSE , has been confirmed in a cow that died rather than having been slaughtered , the ministry said . 
The EU said the program was one of 82 programs tackling 10 major animal diseases , including rabies , mad cow , and scrapie , a similar brain-wasting disease found in sheep . 
All results came back negative for the disease .
