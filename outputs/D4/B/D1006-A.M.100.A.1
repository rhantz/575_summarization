So why is Merck recalling the drug now ? 
The FDA said last week after Vioxx was withdrawn that the problems were unique to that drug . 
That means Vioxx results can not automatically be extended to Celebrex and Bextra , which are in the Cox-2 classification with Vioxx but are not identical to it . 
Vioxx was easier on the stomach than aspirin , but it cost more . 
Or were they persuaded to do so by Merck's advertising ? 
`` This morning Merck is announcing a voluntary worldwide withdrawal of Vioxx , '' Gilmartin began .
