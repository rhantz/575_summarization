Japan , where whale meat is part of culinary culture , reluctantly halted commercial whaling in line with a 1986 IWC moratorium . 
Earlier this week Prime Minister John Howard personally wrote to his Japanese counterpart , Junichiro Koizumi , urging him to scrap the plan to increase Japan 's whale kill . 
It has applied to the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) for permission to nearly double its annual catch of Minke whales , currently set at 440 , and to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union .
