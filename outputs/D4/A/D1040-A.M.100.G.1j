`` They convicted Mr. Blake on the night of the murder and then they conducted an incompetent investigation , '' defense attorney M. Gerald Schwartzbach said . 
Ronald `` Duffy '' Hambleton , a former methamphetamine user , said Blake solicited him to kill his wife . 
Schwartzbach reminded jurors that Gary McLarty testified that Blake never directly asked to kill his wife . 
Blake has pleaded not guilty to killing Bakley . 
Blake contends he was in the restaurant at the time , retrieving a handgun he carried for protection .
