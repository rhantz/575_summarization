Damage from the Indian Ocean tsunami could have been significantly reduced if more coastal areas had maintained their protective shields of mangrove swamps and coral reefs , conservation groups said Thursday .

`` The advantage of mangroves is severalfold , '' Cripps said . 
Mangroves are critical nurseries for many of these fish . 
Both areas were hard hit by the tsunami .
