He said Yellowstone grizzlies represent a relatively small genetic pool . 
`` The Yellowstone grizzly is the Endangered Species Act 's best recovery story , '' said Chris Servheen , a University of Montana professor and head of the federal agency 's grizzly bear recovery team . 
Fish and Wildlife Service is poised to remove the park 's renowned bears from the endangered species list . 
Grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park can weigh up to 600 pounds . 
But Servheen stresses the bears will be monitored closely after they are delisted .
