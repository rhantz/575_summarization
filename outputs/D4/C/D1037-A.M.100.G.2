The Maryland Department of Natural Resources also is considering introducing a nonnative -- and , they hope , disease-resistant -- species to the bay .

By early next year , state and federal agencies expect to complete research on restoring the native oyster to the Chesapeake Bay . 
Last year 's native oyster harvest was about 23,000 bushels , less than 1 percent of the figure 30 years ago .
