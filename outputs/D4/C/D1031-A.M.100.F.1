Damage from the Indian Ocean tsunami could have been significantly reduced if more coastal areas had maintained their protective shields of mangrove swamps and coral reefs , conservation groups said Thursday . 
Both areas were hard hit by the tsunami .

`` The advantage of mangroves is severalfold , '' Cripps said .
