Theo van Gogh , who had received threats over a controversial film he made about Islam , was shot and stabbed to death Tuesday while cycling on an Amsterdam street . 
Police said that the suspect in the killing was a 26-year-old man with dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality . 
Moroccan organisations in The Netherlands condemned the murder and called for calm . 
Van Gogh , 47 , was widely known for his outspoken criticism of Islam and recently caused uproar with a short film linking domestic abuse with the perceived subservient position of women in the Islamic faith .
